        Drilling machine like the drilling fluid  circulates in the borehole to aid in effecient,
         drilling operators that produce gauged boreholes to desired depth.

        Drilling water is a process of drilling holes for purpose of reaching groundwater source.
        I came-up with this idea because water is major problem expecially in our county kajiado
        so i saw that drilling more boreholes and wells will help both people and the livestock 
        to access to clean and enough water.
        Drilling water will also improve our health -facilities as people will maintain good hygiene and  diseasses like diarrhea are easly prevented.
        .Access to clean and fresh water enables people not to get diseasses like typhoid and cholera
        .Enough water will enable people to do farming and produce alot of food which will reduce drought and famine in the region.

       The rise  in global energy demand requires production of gas and oil resources,
        which is large produce of water yet the  knowledge of water produce is unconvetional,
        so we develop a data workforce for identifying potentialy high-water producing wells drilled.
